# map-app
Little JS map game to play with Google maps API







get list of latlong from major world cities
figure out decent zoom level
load a satellite map of random one
user has to guess (give a list of maybe six random choices from list of cities)

simplest way to store city names and info? (get array of citynames w/ Object.keys() method)
{ 
	cityname: [lat, long],
  etc..
          }
