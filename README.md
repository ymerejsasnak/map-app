# map-app
Little JS map game to play with Google maps API







get list of latlong from top pop. us cities (better way to do it in future would be to use some online api to get the info too!)
figure out decent zoom level
load a satellite map of random one
user has to guess (give a list of maybe six random choices from list of cities)

simplest way to store city names and info? (get array of citynames w/ Object.keys() method)
{ 
	cityname: [lat, long],
  etc..
          }


selection of cities
city - lat(N) - long(W) :

NY - 40.6643, 73.9385
LA - 34.0194, 118.4108
Chicago - 41.8376°N 87.6818°W
Houston - 29.7805°N 95.3863°W
Phili - 40.0094°N 75.1333°W
Phoenix - 33.5722°N 112.0880°W
Detroit - 42.3830°N 83.1022°W
Memphis - 35.1035°N 89.9785°W
Seattle - 47.6205°N 122.3509°W
Denver - 39.7618°N 104.8806°W
Boston - 42.3320°N 71.0202°W
L Vegas - 36.2277°N 115.2640°W


should probably add some more after it all works!
