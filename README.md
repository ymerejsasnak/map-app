# map-app
Little JS map game to play with Google maps API







add some more cities!
possible future change:  find api online that I can load cities from and get them that way instead of entering them into data by hand!



fix end game code so it doesn't just stop, it lets you restart (reload the script?) by clicking
(also need to disable buttons while win message is on?)


disable buttons between initial click and next map!!!
